## :crystal_ball: About Me
My name is Maria Fernanda Ibarra, I'm from Costa rica.
With a very different background coming from Marketing & Graphic Design. After working in the technology industry for a couple of years, I felt inlove with software engineering, building strong technical knowledge and important soft skills, gaining work experience as a Front End and Back End developer since 2019.
Always committed to excellence, passionate about my career and proud of my journey.
